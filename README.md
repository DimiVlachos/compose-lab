# compose-lab

Compose Multiplatform components, rebuilt from scratch and recorded as short clips. Each component lives in its own package under `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/dev/dimvlachos/lab/` and runs the same on Android and iOS.

## Nav bar (`core/presentation/components/navbar/`)

One bar, five layers that can each be switched on or off. Nothing recomposes while it animates: every animated value is read in the layout or draw phase. The app's demo, `navbar.all`, runs the finished bar; the GIFs below show each layer on its own.

| Layer | What it shows |
|---|---|
| ![](docs/media/navbar.indicator.gif) | **Morphing indicator.** The leading and trailing edges run on different springs. |
| ![](docs/media/navbar.icons.gif) | **Animated icons.** A circular reveal of the filled icon, with a squash and bounce. |
| ![](docs/media/navbar.scroll.gif) | **Collapse on scroll.** A nested-scroll observer shrinks the bar into a floating pill, and settles it to fully open or fully collapsed on release. |
| ![](docs/media/navbar.cutout.gif) | **Moving cutout.** A notch cut with `Path.combine`, following the bubble. The notch itself rides a calm, non-bouncing centre while the bubble leans into its travel and bulges on landing. |
| ![](docs/media/navbar.cutoutmorph.gif) | **Cutout morph.** The notch hugs the bubble as it sinks into the bar, then hands off to an in-bar pill, riding that same calm centre while the bubble leans into its travel and bulges on landing. |
| ![](docs/media/navbar.action.gif) | **Action button.** A jelly button squirts out of the bar on tabs that have one, and shrinks the bar to make room. |
| ![](docs/media/navbar.all.gif) | **Everything together.** |
| ![](docs/media/navbar.recompositions.gif) | **Frames vs recompositions.** Frames climb; the bar recomposes only on a tap. |

```kotlin
val items = listOf(
    NavItem(
        label = "Home",
        icon = Res.drawable.ic_home,
        selectedIcon = Res.drawable.ic_home_filled,
        action = NavAction(Res.drawable.ic_add, "New post"),
    ),
    NavItem(label = "Search", icon = Res.drawable.ic_search, selectedIcon = Res.drawable.ic_search),
    NavItem(label = "Saved", icon = Res.drawable.ic_saved, selectedIcon = Res.drawable.ic_saved_filled),
    NavItem(label = "Profile", icon = Res.drawable.ic_profile, selectedIcon = Res.drawable.ic_profile_filled),
)

val scrollState = rememberNavBarScrollState()

AnimatedNavBar(
    items = items,
    selectedIndex = selected,
    onSelect = { selected = it },
    onActionClick = { index -> /* the tapped tab's action fired */ },
    layers = NavBarLayers.All,
    scrollState = scrollState, // also add Modifier.nestedScroll(scrollState.nestedScrollConnection) to your list
)
```

## Profile gallery (`core/presentation/components/gallery/`)

![](docs/media/morph.app.gif)

One screen where everything that opens is a shared-element morph, all in one `SharedTransitionLayout`:

- **Photo.** A grid card grows into the full-screen photo and back (a container transform). The corners are paired, so the card's 16 dp and the photo's 0 dp meet halfway instead of a square photo showing through a rounded card. The title and caption follow the photo as it grows.
- **Profile photo.** The avatar zooms into a large circle over a scrim. A pencil button then morphs into a "Change profile photo" dialog, and back into the button.
- **Search.** The search button grows into a bar, and search opens as its own page, cross-fading with the gallery. Recent searches show until the query types in, then the matching photos, which glide into place as each letter narrows them.
- **Collapsing header.** As the grid scrolls, the avatar shrinks into a top bar with a shadow, following the finger.

Taps are serialised by a morph gate: one that arrives mid-morph waits for the morph to land, so an interrupted transition never leaves a stray copy behind. Nothing recomposes while anything morphs or scrolls. The system back gesture closes the topmost layer.

```kotlin
ProfileGallery(
    name = "Alex Morgan",
    portrait = Res.drawable.portrait,
    photos = photos, // List<MorphPhoto>(image, title, caption)
    searchQuery = "xos",
    recentSearches = listOf("Santorini", "Milos", "Hydra"),
    scene = scene, // GalleryScene(photo, avatar, dialog, search)
    onSceneChange = { scene = it },
)
```

The photo morph also ships on its own as `ImageMorph` (`core/presentation/components/imagemorph/`), with `MorphLayers` to switch its fixes on one by one.

## Agentic UI, A2UI (`androidApp/.../agenticdemo/`, Android only)

A chat where the agent answers with native UI instead of text. The agent (OpenAI or Claude) writes [A2UI v0.9](https://a2ui.org/) messages, and the [Jetpack Compose A2UI renderer](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/agentic) draws them from a catalog this app registers. The agent can only use what the catalog declares, and no generated code runs on the device.

```
you type ──▶ ConciergeAgent (OpenAI | Claude) ──stream──▶ JsonlLineSplitter ──line──▶ A2uiMessageProcessor ──▶ A2uiSurface
   ▲                                                                              │
   └──────────── A2uiWireMapper ◀── outboundEvents (taps, validation errors) ◀─────┘
```

- **Hybrid catalog.** The Material 3 Basic Catalog plus two custom components: `RatingBar`, whose stars write back to the data model through `bindUpdater`, and `StatTile`, which re-animates when an `updateDataModel` arrives. The catalog's JSON schema is exported into the system prompt with `toJsonSchemaString()`, so the prompt always matches what is registered.
- **Progressive rendering.** Each JSONL line goes to the processor as soon as it closes, so cards appear while the model is still writing.
- **The loop back.** Button events and form values reach the agent as its next turn. Parse and validation errors are sent back as well, at most twice per turn, so the agent can correct itself.
- **Theme.** The lab's colours reach the Basic Catalog through a `MaterialTheme`.

To run it, add `openai.apiKey=sk-…` (optionally `openai.model=…`, default `gpt-6-luna`) or `anthropic.apiKey=sk-ant-…` to `local.properties` and launch `agentic.concierge`. When both keys are set, OpenAI is used. Launched with `--ez replay true`, the demo plays a scripted conversation from `assets/a2ui/replay/` instead, with no key and no cost; record it with `scripts/record.py android agentic.concierge --flag replay --seconds 25` and use it while the clip runs. The key is compiled into the debug APK, which is fine for a local demo but must never ship: a real app should call the agent from a backend. The A2UI libraries have no iOS build, so this demo is not in the iOS app. `a2ui/*.json` in the assets comes from [google/A2UI](https://github.com/google/A2UI) (Apache 2.0).

## Run

Prerequisites: macOS with Xcode for iOS and for the iOS tests (`iosSimulatorArm64Test`), an Android SDK (`ANDROID_HOME` or `local.properties`'s `sdk.dir`), Python 3 and ffmpeg for recording, and [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) for iOS.

- Android: `./gradlew :androidApp:installDebug`
- iOS: boot a simulator, then run `scripts/install-ios.sh`
- Tests: `./gradlew :composeApp:iosSimulatorArm64Test`
- Architecture (Konsist): `./gradlew :androidApp:testDebugUnitTest`
- Formatting: `./gradlew spotlessApply`

## Record a clip

Every demo plays a timed script that ends where it started, so clips loop cleanly.

```bash
scripts/record.py android navbar.all              # out/navbar.all-android.mp4 (1080×1350, 60 fps, ≤ 5 MB)
scripts/record.py ios navbar.all
scripts/record.py android navbar.all --label && scripts/record.py ios navbar.all --label
scripts/side-by-side.sh navbar.all                 # out/navbar.all-both.mp4
scripts/gif.sh navbar.all                          # docs/media/navbar.all.gif
```

Needs Python 3 and ffmpeg.

## Envelope

The nav bar supports 2–4 tabs, at a minimum slot width of about 64 dp.

The profile gallery shows photos in 2 columns of 4:5 cards. Opening one photo straight from another is not a morph: close to the grid first.
